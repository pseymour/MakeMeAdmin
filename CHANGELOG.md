## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added

- Added an optional dialog box to prompt the user to enter their reason for needing administrator rights.
- Added the ability to log off a user when their administrator rights expire. The message displayed before log off is customizable.
- Added logging of elevated processes.
- Added the ability to prompt the user for authentication before rights are granted.
- Added a setting to control which port the remote feature uses. 
- Added feature to allow renewal of rights after expiration.
- Added a setting to control whether the UI closes after the user's rights expire.
- Added Danish translation, thanks to **Bj√∏rn Kelsen**.
- Modified the installer to remove the added user XML file upon uninstallation.
- Modified the installer to add the product version to the registry.
  - The version number will be stored in the value ``InstalledVersion`` at ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Sinclair Community College\Make Me Admin``.

### Changed

- Significant speed improvement in the code that checks the user against the allowed and denied lists, thanks to [Martin Sheppard](https://github.com/martshep).
- Changed the service's Event Log source name to "Make Me Admin," adding spacing between the words.
- Updated group policy templates to reflect change from SIDs only to SIDs or names, thanks to **Jakob Dahl**.
- Migrated from .NET Framework version 4.5.2 to version 4.8.

### Removed

- Removed the Exit button from the UI.
- Turned off automatic logging for service start and stop events.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that would prevent syslogging from working if the syslog server was not in DNS.
- Fixed an issue where the service would check the authorization of the wrong principal, in automatic-add scenarios. (Issue #50)
- Fixed typos in French translation.
- Added better error handling in the UI app if the service is not listening.



## [2.3-fr] - 2019-02-04

### Changed

- Changed French localization from fr-CA to fr.


## [2.3] - 2019-01-31

### Added

- Added localization for French. Initially, this was mistakenly coded as fr-CA, but it was later changed to fr. Big thanks to **Etienne Croteau**, both for translating the English strings into French and for nudging me into internationalization.
- Added elements to the installer project so that the Make Me Admin service would be restarted
upon first/second/third failure.
- Added syslog functionality.
- Changed the added user file to use encryption, to discourage tampering.
- Specified a license of GPLv3.
- Added the ability to automatically add certain users when they log on.
- The UI now checks to see if the user is an administrator at all, instead of directly in the Administrators group, for the purposes of enabling "Grant Me Rights" button.
- The application now supports names of users or groups, in addition to the previous option of SIDs.

### Changed

- Changed the path of the encrypted added user list from the CommonApplicationData folder to the user's Application Data folder. In this case, the user is the System account.
- Updated code related to users whose rights do not expire.
- Simplified logging code by removing separate Information, Warning and Error logging functions.
- Changed the default timeout for admin rights to ten minutes, rather than two.
- Slight change to the way membership in the local Administrators group is checked.

### Fixed

- Added explanatory text in the ADML file for the syslog server settings.


## [2.2.1] - 2018-01-18

### Added

- Added code to use the WCF security context to identify the user being added or removed from the
Administrators group, rather than passing SIDs around as strings.
- Added remote request application, to allow users to gain administrative rights on other devices. The
feature includes its own separate allow/deny lists, a setting to permit remote requests, and a setting
to end remote sessions on a device once that user's rights have expired.

### Changed

-  The list of SIDs that have been added to the local Administrators group is now encrypted. This is really
just to prevent casual browsing of the list. It is not a secure list really, because the user gains
administrator rights and can do whatever they want to the file, including delete it.

### Removed

- Removed Sinclair-specific user manuals.


## [2.1.3] - 2017-07-17

### Added

- Added a setting to override the removal of admin rights by an outside process.
- Added different user manuals for Windows 7, 8 and 10.
- Added logic to the setup project to install the appropriate user manual based on operating system.
- Added logging for the reason that administrator rights were removed (timeout, log off, etc.)

### Deprecated

- The user manuals are deprecated, as they are somewhat specific. They will likely be removed and posted to a company website.


## [2.1.0] - 2016-02-18

### Added

- Added a setting to specify different rights timeouts for different users or groups.
- Added a setting to remove administrative rights when the user logs out.
- Added Group Policy templates (ADMX and ADML files) to control configuration settings.
- Added the ability to specify settings as preferences (mutable) or via policy (immutable).
- Added the user's name, if available, to the logging of additions to and removals from the Administrators group.
- Added logic to the installer to remove the added users list upon uninstallation.
- Added logic to the installer to remove the folder from Program Files upon uninstallation.
- Added logging for the case where a user is removed from Administrators by a process other than Make Me Admin (Group Policy, for example).


## 2015-11-20

### Added

- Modified the setup project to include the version number in the output MSI file name.
- For debug builds, the word "Debug" is now added to the end of the Windows Installer file name.

### Changed

- Renamed the shortcut for the user manual to "Make Me Admin User Manual," instead of just "User Manual."


## [2.0.0] - 2015-03-17

Initial commit to GitHub. Prior to this commit, Make Me Admin was a semi-private project at Sinclair Community College. The code was briefly available via Sinclair's public Bitbucket server, but no installers were available.
